# Implementation Tasks: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Task Overview
Total Tasks: [X] | Estimated Time: [X] hours | Status: NOT_STARTED

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during systematic generation from design artifacts*

### From Design Artifacts
- **Each contract file** → contract test task [P]
- **Each entity** → model creation task [P] 
- **Each endpoint** → implementation task
- **Each user story** → integration test [P]
- **Each shared interface** → shared resource task

### Ordering Rules
- **Setup** → **Tests** → **Models** → **Services** → **Endpoints** → **Polish**
- **Tests MUST precede implementation** (TDD enforcement)
- **Dependencies block parallel execution**

### Parallel Task Rules ([P])
- Different files + no dependencies = [P] allowed
- Same file modified = NO [P] (sequential only)
- Auto-validated during generation

## Task Types

### Infrastructure Tasks (No TDD Required)
- **Setup**: Project initialization, dependencies, configuration
- **Database Schema**: Table creation, migrations, indexes
- **File Structure**: Directory creation, basic file setup
- **Configuration**: Environment setup, build configuration

### Behavior Tasks (TDD Required)
- **Contract Test**: API contract validation (must fail initially)
- **Integration Test**: User journey validation
- **Core Implementation**: Models, services, business logic
- **Endpoint**: API implementation
- **Shared Resource**: Creates shared interfaces/utilities
- **Polish**: Unit tests, performance optimizations

## Tasks

### task-01: [Task Name]
**Type**: Infrastructure | Behavior
**Category**: Setup | Database Schema | Contract Test | Integration Test | Core Implementation | Endpoint | Shared Resource | Polish
**TDD Required**: Yes | No
**Status**: NOT_STARTED
**Fulfills**: REQ-001, REQ-002
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Time**: [X] hours

#### Shared Resource Details (if applicable)
- **Resource**: src/shared/interfaces/[Name] or src/shared/utilities/[Name]
- **Role**: Provider | Consumer
- **Contract**: [Interface specification or utility API]
- **Consumers**: [List of features that will use this]

#### Implementation Approach

**For Behavior Tasks (TDD Required):**
1. **RED Phase** - Write failing tests:
   ```typescript
   // test/[test-file].test.ts
   describe('[Component]', () => {
     it('should [expected behavior]', () => {
       // Test implementation
     });
   });
   ```
2. **GREEN Phase** - Implement minimum code:
   - [ ] Create [file/component]
   - [ ] Implement [core logic]
   - [ ] Make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase** - Improve code quality:
   - [ ] Extract common functions
   - [ ] Add proper types
   - [ ] Update documentation

**For Infrastructure Tasks (No TDD):**
1. **Implementation** - Follow concrete specifications:
   - [ ] Create [database table/config file]
   - [ ] Validate against specification
   - [ ] Verify setup works correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Types check
- [ ] Code reviewed

#### Files to Create/Modify
- `CREATE: src/[path]/[file]`
- `MODIFY: src/[path]/[file]`

### task-02: [Task Name]
**Type**: Feature Task | Shared Resource | Integration  
**Status**: NOT_STARTED  
**Fulfills**: REQ-003  
**Dependencies**: task-01  
**Estimated Time**: [X] hours

#### TDD Cycle
1. **RED Phase** - Write failing tests:
   ```typescript
   // Test cases to write
   ```
2. **GREEN Phase** - Implement minimum code:
   - [ ] Implementation steps
3. **REFACTOR Phase** - Improve code quality:
   - [ ] Refactoring steps

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criteria

#### Files to Create/Modify
- `CREATE: [files]`
- `MODIFY: [files]`

### task-03: [Task Name]
**Type**: Feature Task | Shared Resource | Integration  
**Status**: NOT_STARTED  
**Fulfills**: REQ-004, REQ-NFR-001  
**Dependencies**: task-02  
**Estimated Time**: [X] hours

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All requirements have corresponding tasks
- [ ] Dependencies correctly ordered
- [ ] Each task independently testable
- [ ] Atomic commits possible for each task
- [ ] Time estimates realistic
- [ ] Shared resources identified and typed
- [ ] Provider/consumer relationships clear

## Observability Acceptance
- [ ] Structured logs with correlation IDs added in changed code paths
- [ ] Error taxonomy applied (Validation/AuthN/AuthZ/NotFound/ServerError)
- [ ] Key metrics/traces updated if applicable

## Coverage & Performance
- [ ] Changed lines + impacted functions covered
- [ ] Coverage ≥90% statements/branches/functions on changed files
- [ ] Performance targets from NFRs validated

## Rollback Points
- After task-01: [How to rollback]
- After task-03: [Checkpoint for major change]

## Risk Mitigation
- If task-X fails: [Contingency plan]
- Performance concerns in task-Y: [Alternative approach]

## Parallelization Rules ([P])
- Mark [P] only for different files with no dependency relations
- Do not allow [P] when two tasks modify the same file
